The following script gets a username.
1. Reset the user password to: Aa123456.
2. Unlock user.
3. Add an "il-10" prefix to the username and check if there is such a computer name in the domain, if not, add 1 at a time up to 4 times.
4. Sends a message to the computer that found "Password changed to: Aa123456".
5. If the computer is not found the script prompts to manually enter the name of the computer and then sends the message.#>
